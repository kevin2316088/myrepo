        "1. In the first part of the program, the doctors conduct a new discharge assessment protocol using innovative evidence-based tools to help them decide whether patients are ready to return to their usual place of residence or if it would be more advisable to transfer them to an intermediate or short-term care facility. As such, this program is set to replace the previous protocol concerning where patients should be discharged.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. The second part of the program includes a group of nurses, physiotherapists, and occupational therapists who visit patients at home or in the intermediate facility after discharge. The frequency of these visits is determined by an assessment conducted prior to discharge, averaging about five visits per patient. Among other things, the team's tasks include ensuring proper wound healing, checking medication compliance, coordinating with a general practitioner or the medical team at the intermediate facility, and assessing the patient's ability to perform basic daily activities such as navigating their environment, using the toilet, and showering. Furthermore, the specialised unit maintains regular telephone contact with patients to check on their well-being. Patients are also encouraged to reach out to the unit if they need any assistance.\n",

The hospital aims to capture as many \"readmissions\" as possible (true positives), even if this moderately increases the number of false positives within reason (i.e., patients not at risk of readmission classified as such). However, be mindful that the hospital does not have unlimited resources. An excessive number of patients identified as at-risk could inflate the operational costs of the \"specialised unit\" beyond sustainable levels.\n",
